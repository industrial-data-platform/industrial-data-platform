# Agent Instructions

This file is the canonical entrypoint for AI agents working in this repository.
Read it first, then read the closest scoped `AGENTS.md` for the paths you touch,
and finally check `docs/agents/module-map.yaml` for ownership and validation.

## Mission

This repository is an industrial data collection platform monorepo. The current
architecture is:

- `Industrial Data Platform`: data ingestion, delivery, contracts, Kafka event
  log, Config Registry, ClickHouse Telemetry Store, PostgreSQL Platform Store,
  and local data-platform infrastructure.
- `Edge Telemetry Agent`: on-site runtime that reads southbound sources,
  normalizes observations, buffers locally, and publishes telemetry/status.
- `Web Monitoring Module`: dashboards, history, latest values, and read-only
  visualization over data-platform read models.
- `Alarm Management Module`: future rule engine, alarm lifecycle, workflow, and
  notifications. Runtime code is not present yet.

## Source Of Truth

Use this order when sources disagree:

1. `docs/contracts/` for MQTT/Kafka/ClickHouse/storage wire contracts, topic
   names, table names, schema details, and compatibility.
2. `arch/likec4/` for C4 systems, containers, ownership, dependencies, and
   deployment views.
3. `docs/architecture/current-state.md`, `docs/architecture/glossary.md`, and
   `docs/architecture/open-questions.md` for the current working snapshot.
4. `docs/architecture/decisions.md` for the compact decision register.
5. Package READMEs and implementation guides for local usage details.

Archived ADRs in `docs/architecture/adrs/archive/` are historical rationale,
not default source-of-truth. Open them only when you need decision context,
trade-offs, or rejected alternatives.

If a contract document and an ADR disagree on fields, topics, tables, or schema
shape, the contract document wins and the living docs or decision register need
a follow-up update.

## Compatibility Rules

Do not rename these without an explicit migration plan and user approval:

- Python packages/imports/entrypoints: `edge_telemetry_agent`, `idp_config_registry`,
  `idp_telemetry_store`, `edge-telemetry-agent`, `idp-config-registry`, `idp-telemetry-store`.
- Docker Compose services, image names, and the compose project name.
- MQTT topic tree `idp/v1/...`.
- Kafka topics and message ids with `idp.*`.
- ClickHouse table/view names and migration filenames.
- Contract ids under `docs/contracts/`.

`idp.*` is a stable wire prefix. It is not a reason to reintroduce the
old product boundary name.

## Working Rules

- Keep changes scoped to the requested module and ownership boundary.
- Never revert unrelated user changes in a dirty worktree.
- Do not use destructive git commands unless the user explicitly asks.
- Prefer `rg` / `rg --files` for search.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- Update docs/contracts/C4 when behavior, boundaries, deployment paths, or
  public interfaces change.
- Do not add a new runtime module for Alarm Management until the alarm use cases
  are selected.
- For external libraries or service APIs, verify current docs before changing
  version-sensitive code.

## Skill Routing

- Use this routing data before selecting issue-related workflows:
  - `issue-planning`: create, draft, rewrite, split, template, or
    readiness-review an issue for future agent work. Output is an issue body,
    issue template, or agent-ready task specification.
  - `issue-workflow`: implement, take, fix, continue, or prepare a branch for
    an existing issue number or URL. Output is code/docs/tests/validation/PR
    status for that issue.
  - `github:github`: summarize or triage GitHub repositories, issues, PRs,
    labels, comments, or metadata when no agent-ready issue draft or
    implementation is requested.
  - `github:gh-address-comments`: address actionable PR review feedback.
  - `github:gh-fix-ci`: debug or fix failing GitHub Actions checks.
  - `github:yeet`: commit, push, and open a PR after local work is ready.
- For GitHub issue creation, templates, readiness reviews, or adapting issues
  for agents, use the repo `issue-planning` skill before generic `git` or
  `github` workflows.
- For issue-driven implementation or preparation from issue links or numbers,
  including Russian prompts like "реализуй issue", "сделай реализацию issue",
  "возьми задачу", or "возьми тикет", use the repo `issue-workflow` skill
  before generic `git` or `github` workflows.
- Before implementing an issue, switch to the mainline branch, pull the latest
  changes with `git pull --ff-only`, then create a fresh
  `codex/issue/<issue-number>-<short-slug>` branch. Do not implement issue work
  directly on the mainline branch.
- If the current branch has uncommitted changes before issue work, stop and
  offer options: commit them, stash them, create a separate branch for them,
  keep working on the current branch if it is already the intended issue branch,
  or cancel/postpone the issue work. Do not auto-stash, reset, or move changes
  without explicit user confirmation.
- For general GitHub repository, issue, or PR triage, use `github:github`.
- For PR review comments or requested changes, use `github:gh-address-comments`.
- For failing GitHub Actions or CI debugging, use `github:gh-fix-ci`.
- For committing, pushing, and opening a PR, use `github:yeet`.

## Repository Map

- `apps/edge_telemetry_agent/`: Edge Telemetry Agent runtime.
- `apps/idp_config_registry/`: Industrial Data Platform Config Registry.
- `apps/knx_demo/`: KNX demo utilities, not a production module.
- `libs/knx_project_parser/`: ETS `.knxproj` parsing library.
- `libs/idp_demo_stack/`: demo and integration glue, not a production module.
- `tools/idp_telemetry_store/`: Telemetry Store migration and load-PoC CLI.
- `infra/local/`: local Industrial Data Platform stack and Web Monitoring
  surface.
- `arch/`: LikeC4 architecture model and generated site tooling.
- `docs/contracts/`: canonical data and storage contracts.
- `docs/architecture/`: architecture docs, decision register, ADR archive,
  glossary, and open questions.
- `docs-site/`: internal Starlight documentation site over curated repo docs.
- `docs/agents/`: agent workflows, roles, templates, and module map.

## Validation Matrix

- Python package change: run the package test command from
  `docs/agents/module-map.yaml`; add integration tests when the data path is
  affected.
- Contract change: validate affected tests and update docs under
  `docs/contracts/`; breaking changes need a new contract version.
- C4 change: run `cd arch && npm run validate`.
- Local infra change: run `docker compose -f infra/local/compose.yaml config
  --quiet`; run relevant integration tests.
- Agent/docs only: run `git diff --check`, parse
  `docs/agents/module-map.yaml`, build `docs-site`, and verify links/references
  with `rg`.

## Agent Workflow

For larger work, use `docs/agents/workflows/task-flow.md` and the role
prompts in `docs/agents/roles/`. Local scratch runs may live under `.local/`,
which is intentionally ignored by git.

For issue-driven work, create a visible task plan from the issue phases before
implementation so the plan appears in the Codex side panel. Keep at most one
step in progress and update the plan after each phase, validation failure, or
scope change.

After reading an issue or task, select the minimal applicable skills from
repo-local `.agents/skills` and available system/session skills. Announce the
selected skills and why before implementation; if no additional skill applies,
say that explicitly.

Ask the user only for blocking decisions that cannot be resolved from repository
source-of-truth documents or existing issue context. Prefer one concise batch of
1-3 questions, include a default assumption for each, and record accepted
answers or assumptions back into the issue, PR, or final status.
